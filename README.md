Quick DBD was used to create framework for tables.

Jonathan from AskBCS Learning Assistant on Slack helped with the wording for foreign keys in Quick DBD as well the ordering of the tables so the foreign keys made sense. I was previously not putting a space between "FK" and "-".

Liang from AskBCS Learning Assistant on Slack helped with explaining how composite keys functionally work.

--------------------------------------------------
Analysis
--------------------------------------------------

Khan from AskBCS Learning Assistant on Slack helped me figure out why I needed quotes around all of my table and column titles, allowing me to get past the error messages I was getting.

Bigyan from AskBCS Learning Assistant on Slack helped with the creation of the following line:

    "Employees"."Hire_Date" between  '1986-01-01' and '1986-12-31'

To convert the date type to a string to search though them and narrow the selection down.
